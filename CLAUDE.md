## Overview

This repository contains the code for the Julia package DBN.jl. The package is used to read and write Databento Binary Encoding (DBN) files. See @README.md for more details.

The package is not yet complete, but it is a work in progress. We are going to finish it together.

## Reference Implementations

The official DBN implementations have been downloaded in the dbn directory.
