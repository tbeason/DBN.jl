## Phase 9: Edge Cases and Error Handling ✅ (Partially Complete)

- [x] Test reading invalid/corrupted files
- [x] Test writing to read-only locations
- [x] Test handling of empty files
- [x] Test very large files
- [x] Test files with mixed record types
- [x] Test boundary values for timestamps and prices

**Phase 9 Status**: Basic edge case tests implemented covering core scenarios:

- ✅ Invalid file formats, corrupted headers, truncated files
- ✅ Empty files and header-only files
- ✅ Basic boundary values for prices and timestamps
- ✅ Mixed record types in single files
- ✅ Large file handling with 1000+ records
- ✅ Basic permission error handling for read-only locations

**Incomplete/Advanced Edge Cases (30-40% remaining)**:

❌ **Corrupted Record Data Testing**

- Problem: Uses non-existent `DBNEncoder(string_path, metadata)` constructor
- Missing: Proper low-level file corruption simulation after valid header creation
- Technical Issue: `DBNEncoder` requires IO objects, not file paths

❌ **Invalid Enum Values Testing**

- Problem: `reinterpret(Action.T, 0xFF)` may not test actual error handling paths
- Missing: Verification that DBN reader gracefully handles invalid enum values
- Technical Issue: Julia's enum system complexity

❌ **Advanced String Field Boundaries**

- Problem: `InstrumentDefMsg` creation is complex, string edge cases not fully tested
- Missing: Unicode handling, null termination, field overflow behavior
- Technical Issue: String padding/truncation verification incomplete

❌ **Advanced Write Permission Scenarios**

- Problem: Only tests system directory access, limited scope
- Missing: Read-only file overwriting, disk space exhaustion, network drives, concurrent access
- Technical Issue: Platform-dependent permission scenarios

❌ **Memory-Mapped File Edge Cases**

- Problem: Sketched but not implemented
- Missing: Large file memory mapping limits, multiple concurrent readers, file locking
- Technical Issue: Memory mapping testing requires sophisticated setup

❌ **Advanced Compression Edge Cases**

- Problem: Only basic compressed empty file testing
- Missing: Corrupted compressed files, compression ratio edge cases, mixed scenarios
- Technical Issue: Compression corruption simulation complexity

❌ **Concurrent Access Testing**

- Problem: Doesn't properly simulate race conditions
- Missing: True concurrent read/write scenarios, file locking behavior
- Technical Issue: Concurrency testing requires multi-threading setup

**Implementation Blockers**:

1. Constructor API mismatch (`DBNEncoder` file path vs IO object)
2. Enum system complexity for invalid value testing
3. Platform dependencies for permission tests
4. Concurrency testing infrastructure requirements

**Recommendation**: Core edge case functionality is robust for production use. Advanced edge cases can be addressed in future iterations when more sophisticated testing infrastructure is available.

## Phase 10: Integration and Performance Testing ✅

- [x] Test with sample DBN files from reference implementation (located in test/data)
- [x] Benchmark read/write performance
- [x] Memory usage profiling
- [x] Test thread safety of compress_daily_files
- [x] Export to Parquet/CSV/JSON functionality

**Phase 10 Status**: Complete integration and performance testing implemented with comprehensive coverage:

- ✅ **Sample File Compatibility**: Successfully tested with official DBN reference files including trades, MBO, MBP, OHLCV, definitions, status, and imbalance data
- ✅ **Compressed File Support**: Verified compatibility with Zstd-compressed files (.dbn.zst)

- `dbn_to_csv()`, `dbn_to_json()`, `dbn_to_parquet()` export functions
- `records_to_dataframe()` for DataFrame conversion with type safety
- Performance benchmarking infrastructure using BenchmarkTools.jl

## Phase 11: Compliance Testing

- [ ] Compare output with reference implementation (byte-for-byte)
- [ ] Validate all record layouts match DBN v2 spec
- [ ] Test interoperability with official DBN tools

## Implementation Notes

### Test Data Creation Strategy

1. Start with synthetic test data for basic functionality
2. Create minimal valid DBN files for each test case
3. Use reference implementation samples for compliance testing

### Testing Approach

1. Create a test/ directory with organized test files (located in test/data)
2. Use Julia's built-in Test framework
3. Start with the simplest tests and build up
4. Each phase should be completed before moving to the next

### Known Issues to Watch For

- The `read_dbn` and `write_dbn` convenience functions need error handling
- DBNStream is referenced but not implemented
- Some message types (Error, SymbolMapping, System) don't have write implementations
- File position handling in streaming writer header update might have issues

### Priority Order

1. Get basic module loading working (Phase 1)
2. Ensure structs are valid (Phase 2)
3. Test core read/write without compression (Phase 4)
4. Add compression support (Phase 6)
5. Complete missing functionality (Phase 8)
